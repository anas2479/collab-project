                        Ohalanʌ́ht (pronounced ohala-nuht) translates to purple in the Oneida language. Our founding members chose to name our group after the color purple because of the color’s ties to the city of Minneapolis.

                        Purple is the color of Prince (obviously), the color of the Vikings (less important), and the color Babe the Blue Ox turns when he gets a sunburn. For real, though, the cultural boom of Prince and the Minneapolis Sound connected our city to a global audience, leaving an influence that far outstretched the Midwest. And the lights of the Minneapolis skyline still frequently shine purple for this reason. Our collective is purple because we wanted to evoke this global media connection, and continue that funky purple glow in whatever forms of media we create.

                        But why say it in Oneida? Well, one of our founding members is from the Oneida tribe in the Iroquois Nation. His favorite naming trick is to translate titles into Oneida, and when he translated the color purple into the Oneida language, Ohalanʌ́ht was born.
