        question: "If I’m not a member, can I still use the space and resources?",
        answer: `Yes! Ohalanʌ́ht has a rental system for some of our equipment, computers, and our studio/sweep. Our members get first dibs on the calendar, but we open rentals to the public on the first of every month.

        question: `How will the money raised in your campaign be used?`,
        answer:`In order to establish our studio, we will need to purchase computers, software, printers, ink, and all the fun stuff that makes a studio run. All in all, we need about $55,000 to outfit our studio. The remaining amount of our $70,000 goal will cover the first six months of rent as we hit the ground running.`,

        question: `I’m not an artist, but I love your work! How can I get involved?`,

    {
        question: `I’m not an artist yet, how can I get started?`,
        answer: `As part of our commitment to the community, Ohalanʌ́ht plans to hold 1-2 small introductory classes a month on the basic principles of animation, photography, comic art, and whatever else our artists have gotten their hands on. Skills are more fun when you share them! Taking a class or coming to an event is a great way to network with us. Don’t be afraid to reach out.`
